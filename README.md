# Party Identity Bot

This is a bot to manage "sets of nicknames". The idea is to create and store multiple sets of identities for a group of users that can be quickly switched between. I first thought of this idea for our dnd group that's running multiple campaigns. I thought it would be nice to be able to store all our character names in a set to change everyone's nicknames to our characters while we're playing for immersion but easily switch back to real names after the session.

## Configuration

The bot's configuration is done through environment variables. See `.env.example` for a list of the required values. The project will not start without values for all required variables.
